What features the model has learned (via filter visualizations).
How it responds to specific input (via activation maps highlighting what parts of input trigger certain features).
Structure in the learned representation (via embeddings plots).
For instance, in an image classifier, we might show saliency maps (explained below) or filter visualizations to a user to justify: The network pays attention to these image regions which correspond to the object. For a text model, one might highlight words that most influenced a prediction (like attention weights in a transformer can be visualized to show which words in a sentence the model focused on to translate a particular word, etc.).
