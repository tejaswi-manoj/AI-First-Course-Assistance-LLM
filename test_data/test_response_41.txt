The norm of the Gaussian distributions. The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm can estimate the parameters (means, covariances, mixing coefficients) of these Gaussians. The result is a soft clustering: each point has a probability of belonging to each cluster. You can assign it to the cluster with highest probability or just use the distribution. GMM can capture ellipsoidal clusters (through covariance
