First, let’s understand what is bias and variance:

Bias refers to the difference between the actual values and the predicted values by the model. Low bias means the model has learned the pattern in the data and high bias means the model is unable to learn the patterns present in the data i.e the underfitting.
Variance refers to the change in accuracy of the model’s prediction on which the model has not been trained. Low variance is a good case but high variance means that the performance of the training data and the validation data vary a lot.
If the bias is too low but the variance is too high then that case is known as overfitting.
