Overfitting occurs when a model learns unnecessary details in the training data (essentially memorizing the training data). This generally leads to good performance on the training dataset but poor performance on the testing dataset. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the patterns in the training dataset. This generally results in poor performance on both training and testing datasets.
