What features the model has learned (via filter visualizations often response to see if input values, and reconstruct poorly (maybe the autoencoder tries to make it look like normal, failing to replicate the defect), hence high error signals anomaly. Another approach is using a variant like a Variational Autoencoder or an Autoencoder with an explicit constraint that captures distribution of normal data, then anomalies are those that don't fit well into that distribution. There is also the concept of Adversarial Autoencoders and AnoGAN (using GANs for anomaly detection where a generator tries
