A data set that is not separable in different classes in one plane may be separable in another plane. This is exactly the idea behind the SVMin this a low dimensional data is mapped to high dimensional data so, that it becomes separable in the different classes. A hyperplane is determined after mapping the data into a higher dimension which can separate the data into categories.

SVM model can even learn non-linear boundaries with the objective that there should be as much margin as possible between the categories in which the data has been categorized. To perform this mapping different types of kernels are used like radial basis kernel, gaussian kernel, polynomial kernel, and many others.
