As the dimensionality of the input data increases the amount of data required to generalize or learn the patterns present in the data increases. For the model, it becomes difficult to identify the pattern for every feature from the limited number of datasets or we can say that the weights are not optimized properly due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited number of examples used to train the model. Due to this after a certain threshold for the dimensionality of the input data, we have to face the curse of dimensionality.
