No, there are times when we train our model on an imbalanced dataset the accuracy score is not a good metric to measure the performance of the model. In such cases, we use precision and recall to measure the performance of a classification model.

Also, f1-score is another metric that can be used to measure performance but in the end, f1-score is also calculated using precision and recall as the f1-score is nothing but the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
