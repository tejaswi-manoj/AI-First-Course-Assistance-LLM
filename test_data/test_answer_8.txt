Information gain is a measure used in decision trees to select the best feature that splits the data into the most informative subsets. It is calculated based on the reduction in entropy or impurity after a dataset is split on an attribute. Entropy is a measure of the randomness or uncertainty in the data set, and information gain quantifies how much splitting on a particular attribute reduces that randomness.
